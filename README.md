# Istio on EKS

Run your containerized workloads and microservices as part of a service-mesh 
with Istio on EKS! 🚀 

Istio plays a crucial role in enhancing and simplifying microservices-based 
application architectures by providing a powerful and comprehensive service mesh 
solution. Istio abstracts away many of the networking and security complexities 
in microservices-based applications, allowing developers to focus on business 
logic and application functionality. It provides a unified and robust platform 
for managing microservices at scale, improving reliability, security, and 
observability in the modern distributed application landscape. 

This repository, organized in modules, will guide you step-by-step in setting 
Istio on EKS and working with the most commonly observed service-mesh use cases.
